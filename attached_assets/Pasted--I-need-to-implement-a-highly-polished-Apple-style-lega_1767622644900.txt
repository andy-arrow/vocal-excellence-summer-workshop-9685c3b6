"I need to implement a highly polished, 'Apple-style' legal acknowledgment card at the final step of the registration flow, replacing the standard terms checkbox. It must feel native, premium, and seamless.

1. Visual Architecture (The 'Cupertino' Card)
Container Style: Create a div that acts as a summary card.

Background: Use a translucent, off-white background: background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8) with a backdrop blur: backdrop-filter: blur(20px). If that’s too complex, fallback to a solid #F5F5F7 (Apple's standard light gray).

Border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05) (extremely subtle).

Radius: border-radius: 18px (matches modern iOS squircle curvature).

Padding: 24px on all sides.

Shadow: A very soft, diffuse shadow: box-shadow: 0 4px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04).

Typography (System Stack): Use the precise Apple system font stack: font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "SF Pro Text", "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif.

Kerning: Enable font-feature-settings: "kern" 1, -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased.

2. Content Structure (Hierarchy & Layout)
Inside this card, use the following hierarchy:

Header:

Text: Finalizing Your Registration

Style: font-size: 17px, font-weight: 600 (SemiBold), color: #1D1D1F (Apple's almost-black), margin-bottom: 8px.

Intro Text:

Text: Thank you for choosing Vocal Excellence. By proceeding, you acknowledge our [Terms of Use], which help us maintain the high standard of our intensive.

Style: font-size: 14px, line-height: 1.5, color: #86868B (Apple's secondary text gray).

Link Styling: The [Terms of Use] should be a link (<a href="..." target="_blank">). Color: #0066CC (Apple Link Blue). No underline by default; underline on hover.

Key Points List (The 'Concierge' Reminders):

Create a vertical list with 16px vertical spacing between items.

Icon Style: Use Lucide/SVG icons. Size: 18px. Color: #0066CC (primary blue).

Text Style: font-size: 13px, color: #424245.

Layout: Flexbox row (Icon left, Text right, gap 12px).

Content:

(Icon: Lock) <strong>Your Commitment:</strong> Your deposit is non-refundable to secure your seat.

(Icon: ShieldCheck) <strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Tuition becomes non-refundable after June 15, 2026. We warmly recommend travel insurance.

(Icon: Video) <strong>Captured Moments:</strong> We film performances! By joining, you agree Vocal Excellence retains rights to share these moments for promotion.

3. The 'Agree' Interaction (Custom Toggle)
Place this below the card (or inside a footer section of the card):

Layout: Flexbox row, vertically centered, margin-top: 24px.

The Input: Do NOT use a default browser checkbox. Create a custom iOS-style Toggle Switch.

Track: width: 50px, height: 30px, background: #E5E5EA (off) / #34C759 (on - Apple Green). border-radius: 30px.

Thumb: White circle, 26px diameter, box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2). Transition: transform 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1) (spring-like physics).

The Label:

Text: I agree to the terms and am ready to join the program.

Style: font-size: 14px, font-weight: 500, color: #1D1D1F, margin-left: 12px.

Cursor: pointer (clicking the text should toggle the switch).

4. Submit Button Logic (The 'Gatekeeper')
State: The 'Submit Application' / 'Pay Deposit' button must be Disabled by default.

Disabled Style: opacity: 0.3, cursor: not-allowed, filter: grayscale(100%).

Action: When the toggle is switched ON:

Button becomes Enabled.

Enabled Style: opacity: 1, cursor: pointer, transform: scale(1.0) (maybe a tiny pulse animation to signal readiness).

Transition: all 0.4s ease.

Feedback: If a user clicks the button while it is disabled:

Trigger a shake animation on the Toggle Switch row (CSS keyframes: translateX -5px to 5px).

Do NOT show an alert box. Visual feedback only.

5. Mobile Responsiveness
On screens smaller than 480px:

Reduce card padding to 20px.

Stack the Toggle and Label if necessary (though side-by-side usually fits).

Ensure the Toggle touch target is at least 44px high (invisible padding) for accessibility.

Implementation Note: Please ensure all CSS is scoped or using Tailwind classes (if available) to prevent conflicts. The result should look like a native system component from macOS or iOS."</blockquote>
