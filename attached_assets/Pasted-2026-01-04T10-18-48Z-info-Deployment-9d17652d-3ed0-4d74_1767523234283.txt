warn - The class `ease-[cubic-bezier(0.25,0.1,0.25,1)]` is ambiguous and matches multiple utilities.
warn - If this is content and not a class, replace it with `ease-&lsqb;cubic-bezier(0.25,0.1,0.25,1)&rsqb;` to silence this warning.

(!) /home/runner/workspace/src/utils/monitoring.ts is dynamically imported by /home/runner/workspace/src/main.tsx but also statically imported by /home/runner/workspace/src/utils/ErrorBoundary.tsx, dynamic import will not move module into another chunk.

[StorageFactory] Using Replit PostgreSQL backend
Server running on port 5000
a port configuration was specified but the required port was never opened
2026-01-04T10:21:53Z error: The deployment failed because the application failed to open a port in time. This can happen because the application takes to long to open a server, or doesn't open one at all on the expected port. Note that this doesn't mean that the application is crashing, only that it's not opening a port in time. The application must serve traffic on the first port specified as 'localPort' in the port configuration specified in the .replit file. Make sure that the application opens a port quickly and that there are no operations taking too long on startup. Check the logs for more information.
