Master Replit Prompt: Vocal Excellence Website 2026 Update
Role: Expert Full-Stack Developer & Content Strategist.
Objective: Update the entire Vocal Excellence web application from the 2025 cycle to the 2026 cycle.
Context: The current codebase reflects the previous year's event. We need to update all copy, dates, logic, and scheduling variables across the frontend (HTML/Templates) and backend (Routes/Logic).

1. Global Constants & Date Logic
First, establish the following "Source of Truth" variables. Use these to calculate any dynamic dates or text replacements found in the code.

Workshop Year: 2026

Workshop Duration: 7 Days (Previously 5)

Start Date: Monday, June 29, 2026

End Date: Sunday, July 5, 2026

Display String: "29 June - 5 July | Limassol, Cyprus"

Early Bird Deadline: March 1, 2026

Application Deadline: May 24, 2026

Acceptance Notification: June 1, 2026

Final Payment Deadline: June 15, 2026

Price: €749 (Note: Daily average calculation must update: €749 / 7 days ≈ €107/day).

2. Frontend Content Implementation
Scan all template files (likely index.html, apply.html, tuition.html, layout.html or similar in the templates/ or public/ directory) and apply these specific text updates.

A. General/Global Updates (Header/Footer)
Footer: Update Copyright year to 2026.

Navigation: Ensure "Apply Now" links are active and not labeled "Closed."

Status: Change any "Applications Closed" banners/badges to "Applications Open".

Taglines: Replace all instances of "5 Full Days" or "5-day Workshop" with "7 Full Days" or "7-day Workshop".

B. Homepage (#home to #instructors)
Hero Section: Update dates to 29 June - 5 July. Change subheader to "7 Full Days of Exclusive Vocal Training".

Call to Action: Add/Update text near the CTA button: "Early Bird Deadline: March 1".

Intro Text: Change "Applications for 2025 are now closed" to "Applications for 2026 are now open".

C. Application Page (/apply)
Header: Update "SUMMER WORKSHOP 2025" to 2026.

Timeline Component: Update the visible timeline steps to the new logic:

Submit Application: By May 24, 2026

Application Review: May 25 - May 31, 2026

Acceptance Notifications: June 1, 2026

Confirm Participation: By June 15, 2026

Workshop Week: June 29 - July 5, 2026

Final Performance: July 5, 2026

Form Logic: If the form has a hidden field for "Year" or "Cohort," update value to 2026.

D. Tuition Page (/tuition)
Header: Update dates to June 29 - July 5, 2026.

Duration: Update text to "Seven incredible days".

Cost Breakdown: Keep total price €749. Update the daily breakdown text to "Approx €107 per day" (was €150).

Urgency Text: Update "Apply by June 7" to "Apply by May 24".

Payment Plan: Update final payment due date text to "June 15, 2026".

3. Backend & Logic Fixes
Scan main.py, app.py, routes.py, or similar backend files.

A. Route Logic
Countdown Timers: If there is a countdown logic function, target the Early Bird Deadline (March 1, 2026).

Application State: If there is a boolean flag (e.g., APPLICATIONS_OPEN = False), set it to True.

B. Email Notifications
If the backend sends automated confirmation emails (using SMTP or SendGrid):

Update the email subject lines to include "2026".

Update the body text of confirmation emails to reflect the new Start Date (June 29) and Payment Deadline (June 15).

4. Execution Plan
Search & Replace: Perform a global search for "2025" and replace with "2026" in all .html, .js, and .py files.

Date Patching: Perform a global search for "July 14" and replace with "June 29". Search for "July 18" and replace with "July 5".

Content Refinement: Manually verify the "Timeline" and "Tuition" sections match the specific dates listed in Section 1 of this prompt.

Validation: Ensure the server restarts successfully and the /apply route renders the correct 2026 dates.

GO. Implement these changes immediately.
